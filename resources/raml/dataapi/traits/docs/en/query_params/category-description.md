Merchants belong to a subcategory (e.g. bars and cafes) and this subcategory belongs to a category. Each category has one or more subcategories. This parameter is to retrieve specific results of all merchants belonging to a subcategory or a category. You can get a category's and a subcategory's tree information requesting this service /info/merchants_categories. Example es_home. You can turn the filter off by entering the value "all", and the data for all the categories and subcategories will be returned.
