The earliest date to be retrieved. Statistics returned by this request will be bounded by this parameter and date_max, both inclusive. Format YYYY or YYYYMM or YYYYMMDD, where YYYY is year with 4 digits, MM is month of year with 2 digits and DD is day of months with 2 digits. If you enter put only a year YYYY and select group_by month or week, the API autocompletes the date to first month of the year (eg 2014 to 201401), and in the case you select group_by day, the API autocompletes the date to first day of month of this year (eg 2014 to 20140101, 201401 to 20140101).
