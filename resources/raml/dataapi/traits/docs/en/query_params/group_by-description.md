Time grouping (aggregation) (month, week and day). Caution group_by may override you date range defined by date_min/date_max. If you choose a group_by parameter that is a longer time period than the date range specified by the date_min and date_max parameters you will get the whole time period specified by the grouping. For example if you specify date_min=20140118, date_max=20140131, but group_by=month the data returned will be the whole month of January not just the partial range specified.
